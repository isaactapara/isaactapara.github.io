      Ethical hacking is more than running tools â€” it's a way of thinking. It's about understanding how systems can be exploited, not for harm, but to build resilience.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Curiosity Is Your Compass</h3>
    <p>
      The best ethical hackers are relentless explorers. They ask: "What happens if I change this? Can I bypass that? What does this response tell me?" This curiosity drives discovery.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Learn the System Before Breaking It</h3>
    <p>
      You can't exploit what you don't understand. Dive deep into how protocols work, how authentication happens, how data flows. Knowledge is power.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Think Offensively â€” But Ethically</h3>
    <p>
      Your goal is to simulate attackers. Think like them, but act with discipline and authorization. Ethics and intent define your identity as a hacker.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Document Everything</h3>
    <p>
      Real-world ethical hacking isn't just about discovery â€” it's about communication. Good documentation builds trust and proves professionalism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developing the right mindset makes you more than a script kiddie. It makes you a trusted professional who protects digital spaces by truly understanding them.
